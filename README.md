● Transmission

● Owner

🧪 Workflow Overview
1. Data Understanding
Exploratory analysis to understand the structure and types of data.

2. Data Preprocessing

● Handling missing values

● Encoding categorical variables

● Feature selection

3. Feature Engineering

● Creating new relevant features (e.g., age of the car)

4. Data Visualization

● Understanding feature relationships and distributions using Seaborn/Matplotlib

5. Pipeline Creation

● Building a machine learning pipeline using ColumnTransformer and Pipeline

6. Model Evaluation

●  Tried different regression models

●  Evaluated using R² score, MSE

7. Model Saving

● Serialized the model using joblib or pickle for deployment

🧰 Tech Stack
● Python

● Pandas

● Matplotlib, Seaborn

● Scikit-learn

● Jupyter Notebook
